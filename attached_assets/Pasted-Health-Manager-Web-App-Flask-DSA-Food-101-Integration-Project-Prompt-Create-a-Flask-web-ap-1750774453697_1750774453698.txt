Health Manager Web App (Flask + DSA + Food-101 Integration)
🧠 Project Prompt:
Create a Flask web app that combines recipe search, health management, calorie tracking, and AI-based food classification using image data from the Food-101 dataset hosted on Kaggle.

🔗 Dataset Source:
Use the following .h5 dataset from Kaggle:
📂 Food-101 Dataset - food_c101_n10099_r32x32x1.h5

This HDF5 file contains:

images: 10099 grayscale food images resized to 32x32x1

labels: Integer labels corresponding to 101 food categories

🔶 Extended Core Features
✅ 1. Recipe Recognition from Image (Optional ML Module)
Use TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch to load HDF5 image data

Build a lightweight CNN to classify image into one of 101 categories

Match prediction to corresponding recipe

Show name, ingredients, instructions from a supplementary recipe DB (manual CSV/JSON link to labels)

✅ 2. Dataset Loader
Use h5py to load .h5 files:

python
Copy
Edit
import h5py
with h5py.File('food_c101_n10099_r32x32x1.h5', 'r') as f:
    images = f['images'][:]       # shape: (10099, 32, 32, 1)
    labels = f['category'][:]     # shape: (10099,)
Map labels to readable category names using a separate JSON/CSV mapping

✅ 3. Image-Based Search
Users upload a food image → system classifies → suggests recipes

Efficient lookup using hash mapping label → recipe list

(Optional) Recommend similar recipes using cosine similarity in embedding space

🧩 Integrate with Original Features
The system should now support:

Feature	Technology
🍳 Recipe search (name, ingredient, tag)	Trie, HashMap
🧠 Intelligent matching (based on similarity, image recognition)	Set ops, cosine sim
📦 Recipe DB (text + image index)	SQLite + image labels
🩺 Health & calorie manager	Harris-Benedict BMR formula
📧 SMTP alerts	Flask-Mail or smtplib
🧵 UI	Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS, Chart.js

📦 Backend Stack
Flask – Web framework

SQLite/MySQL – Recipe DB

h5py – Load HDF5 .h5 data

TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional) – Image classification

Flask-Mail / smtplib – Email alerts

Jinja2 + HTML/CSS/JS – UI templates

Chart.js – Visualization of nutrient/calorie graphs

✅ Bonus Smart Features
Upload food image → suggest similar recipe

Auto-fill calories from image class

Visual recipe explorer: gallery of all Food-101 categories

Daily goal progress bar, mail summary, and health tips

💻 Example Workflow
User logs in and sets calorie target.

Searches for “pasta” using name or uploads pasta image.

System recognizes image (label pasta_carbonara) and shows 3 similar recipes.

User logs consumption, app tracks calories, and sends evening summary via email.
